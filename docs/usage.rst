``conn2res`` aims to provide a felxible instrument to train connectome-informed
reservoirs to perform different cognitive tasks. 

.. This user guide steps through the basics of fetching microarray expression data
.. from the AHBA, defining an atlas or parcellation for wrangling that data, and
.. actually parcellating the data into a more usable, analyis-ready format. If you
.. still have questions after going through this guide you can refer to the
.. :ref:`api_ref` or ask a question on `GitHub <https://github.com/rmarkello/
.. abagen/issues>`_.
